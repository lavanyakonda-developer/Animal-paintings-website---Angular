## About project

This is a learning project, Developed during learning Angular. This is a e-commerce website where you can buy the animal paintings.

It has features like -

1. See the list of Paintings we have
2. Routing products and cart
3. Add item to cart
4. Search by name of painting
5. Sort by name of painting

We are using Mockoon ( a dummy backend ) - So we can get the list of animal paintings and all, Use the file "Animal Paintings.json" in this repo and create a new environment in Mockoon.

NOTE : Add to cart and checkout don't work as it's a mock app.
